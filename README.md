iOS app for Xiaoxiang BMS

With Xiaoxiang BMS you can build simple Li-Ion or LiFePo4 battery packs. For camping, car or e-bikes (see links below - my projects).

Xiaoxiang BMS can be easily extended with an bluetooth adapter. It makes possible to monitor temperature, voltage, single voltage cell and alarms over your smartphone.

In the V1 only reading of values is supported. If people will like the app, I'm ready to implement in V2 features like:
- calibration
- max / min measurements storage
- charts
